,,,,,,,,
Changes,Reason,,,,,,,
"1. RDS from 2 nodes to 4 nodes
",To serve data to more number of instances and hence supporting more number of users and decreasing load and decreasing latency,,,,,,,
"2. RDS M4 Large to M4 X large
",To process data faster and decrease the response times to decrease the latency,,,,,,,
"3. EC2 upgraded to t3a.large from t3.medium
","To serve more number of users, handle processes more efficiently and decrease latency hence improving user experience",,,,,,,
"4. EC2 configured for daily spike patterns for 8 hours reaching upto 48 instances during peak time
","When during peak times, more number of instances serve more users hence avoiding point of failures and server crashes",,,,,,,
5. EC2 instances are all reserved so to be available at all times ,To make instances available all time,,,,,,,
